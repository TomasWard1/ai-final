# Project Structure

This project is organized into several main folders and subfolders to facilitate easy navigation and management of the codebase. Below is an overview of the project structure:

## Main Folders

### 1. `/data`
This folder contains all the datasets used in the project, including images for test, train, and prediction datasets, as well as a custom-built test set.

### 2. `/model`
This folder includes Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis, model training, and evaluation, as well as optimization files.

### main.ipynb
This is the main notebook of this project. Please start here. Other notebooks are exploratory and are not part of the main submission.

> **Warning:** Running the `main.ipynb` file may take a long time, especially during model training. It is recommended to be selective about the code cells you choose to run. The notebook has already been executed, and the results are displayed, so you don't have to run it yourself.
